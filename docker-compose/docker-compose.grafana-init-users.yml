# docker-compose.grafana-init-users.yml
#
# This service is responsible for initializing Grafana with a viewer user by using the Grafana API.
# It waits for Grafana to be ready and then creates a user with viewer permissions. This is
# necessary because the Grafana does not support user provisioning.
